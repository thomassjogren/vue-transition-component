# Transition component

This is a simple demo of how you can extract transitions into their own components using slots. This example uses the Vue provided JavaScript hooks in order to dynamically alter the height of an element in order to make a smooth slide-down animation.

## Run the example

The easiest way to run the example is to utilize Vue-CLI v3 and the optional Vue cli global service. If you already have Vue CLI v3 installed, you can serve up any `.js` or `.vue` file by running `vue serve <Filename>`. In case you don't have `@vue/cli-service-global` installed, you will be prompted to install that.
